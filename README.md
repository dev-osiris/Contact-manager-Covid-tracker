# Contact and Map app

This app consists of two sections; first is contact manager and second is a covid-19 tracker.

## Contact manager

The contact manager is a straightforward app that lets you add first name, last name and activity
status to a contact. The contacts can be deleted or updated(edited). 

Clicking on one contact expands it to show more details and the options to edit/delete.

## Covid-19 map and charts

The second part utilises data fetching API to fetch data from external API then plot it on a world map, 
along with country-wise data and date-wise data. This can be used to infer statistical information from 
the chain of events.

## Running

In order to run the script:

* clone the repository ```git clone <url of repository>```

* run ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies.

* run ```npm start``` to start the server.
